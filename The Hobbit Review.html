	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>
	<em>"The Hobbit"</em> is a very well know book around being the prequel to <em>"The Lord Of 
	The Rings."</em> It has sold over 100 Million copies world wide being nominated and 
	awarded many awards since 1937. The Author <b>J.R.R Tolkien</b> has even won a nobel prize.
	The story is about a "Hobbit" from a peaceful town called "Bags End" who is called upon onto a 
	quest to steal treasure from a menacing dragon called "Smaug"

	<h3>Review</h3>
	<p>Bilbo has wanted to prove himself from
	the very beginning of the book by pushing himself out of his comfort zone to do extradorinary things.
	Im a big fan of the fantasy element and how much effort was put into the world of "The Hobbit" With
	things such as the magic ring that turns the wearer invisible, and the trolls who turn to stone when exposed 
	to light. There is a lot of effort put into the book. By far my favorite part of the book is when Bilbo is face to face 
	with Smaug, the dragon he is supposed to steal from. This scene shows how much Bilbo has changed and proved
	himself throughout the book. Like when he managed to escape from the trolls in the mountain by himself, and how he
	outsmarted Gollum and his riddles. But most of the power comes from his ring, which was probably the only reason he was 
	still alive throughout the book. Then there was the great war at the end, in which Bilbo managed to trick the other side and 
	let them be turned to stone due to the sunlight.

	<h3>Final Rating</h3> 
	<p>Overall, I would give this book a 9/10. It was an enjoyable book, yet it felt too much like a chore instead of 
	an interesting story. I was focused on finishing this summer reading project quickly and the impatience is kinda what
	made the book less appealing to me.
